## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript


### What I learned

The main purpose of this project was to practice JavaScript and improve CSS intermediate/advanced concepts. The Dark Mode theme was an extra challenge for me since this was my first time implementing it without previous experience at the same time allow me to put in practice problem solving and research skills.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<!-- Input checkbox for add or remove class from body with an id -->
<label for="checkbox" class="switch">
  <input type="checkbox" class="nightmode" id="checkbox">
  <span class="slider"></span>
```
```css
/* if dark-mode class is added set this background */
.dark-mode .main {
  background: #1C1C1C;
}
```
```js
//if the checkbox state is changed, run a funtion
checkbox.addEventListener("change", function() {
  if (checkbox.checked){
    darkmode();
  } else {
    nodark();
  }
})
```

### Continued development

As self taught developer student I'm looking forward to continue my learning path by doing this projects and hope to get ready for a job soon.
